## Sentiment Analysis of Bangla News Comments Using Machine Learning: Project Overview
- Developed a machine learning model that can classify the sentimental category (**`positive, negative and neutral`**) of a news comment written in Bangla Text.
- For the implementation a publicly available [dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n53xt69gnf/3) of **`12k`** news comments have been used. 
- To create the system TF-idf feature extraction technique with n-gram features have been used.
- Analysed the performance of different machine learning algorithms for n-gram feature by using various evaluation metrics such as **`accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score`**.


## Dataset Distribution
The dataset consists of `12K` news comments of five sentiment categories. For the ease of implementation converted this five categories into 3 categories.
